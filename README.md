# Pokemon-Sim
Simple simulator for pokemon-esque battles


All credit for the simulator goes to Rylan Flowers. Here is a link to his video on how to make this:

I have adopted it to work for a western style game I am working on so the code is a little different for me.
I will probably add move advantages and a way to incorporate the speed and luck stats in for missing a target or
going first or twice in a row.

For now, enjoy and happy coding.
